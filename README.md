The Binary Function Computer is  a bytebeat-based oscillator for the modular synth. It was heavily influenced by information found on:

http://countercomplex.blogspot.com/2011/10/algorithmic-symphonies-from-one-line-of.html

Based on the formerly defined binary logic manipulation, toggles equation constants and conditional variation of equations by analysing modular logic signals. It will have a comparator to derive logic-out signals based on the periodic maximum and arithmetic mean of the function values.

The main control of the unit should focus on manipulation and exploration of bytebeat equations, which can be pretty puzzling to figure out in their own. To do so, state change has to predictable, which is why i chose logic inputs over more complex CV-driven manipulation (modulated sine LFO signals for example). Also, i think there are too few interesting logic implementations for modular systems. Im hoping this project can contribute to some change of that.

Furthermore, this text focuses on the theoretical part of defining writing functions with specific tone durations:
